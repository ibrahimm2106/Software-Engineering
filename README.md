Project Description: ZipAbout System
Introduction
The ZipAbout project is a Java-based application developed as part of the Software Development 3 module (CMP020N201) at the University of Roehampton. This innovative project was designed to manage the rental of lightweight electric transport vehicles, such as bikes, scooters, skateboards, and segways. The system incorporates advanced Java programming techniques to provide a rich user interface and enhanced user experience.

System Capabilities
Rental Management:

Provides functionalities for users to rent various electric transport vehicles.
Integrates a dynamic availability tracking system, allowing users to see real-time availability updates for each item.
Advanced Feature Implementation:

Loading Bar: Implemented to enhance the user experience during data processing, providing visual feedback on operation progress.
Multiple Language Support: Allows users to interact with the application in different languages, making the system accessible to a broader audience.
Dynamic Background Changes: Enhances the aesthetic appeal of the GUI, improving user engagement.
Bar Chart Visualization: Offers a graphical representation of rental statistics, aiding users in making informed decisions.
Updated Table Viewer: This feature enables users to clearly see the availability status of items, whether they are available, rented out, or not available for rent.
Development Process
The development was structured into three sprints, focusing on escalating functionalities and user interface enhancements:

Sprint 1: Established the foundation by creating basic classes for different types of transport vehicles, incorporating essential OOP principles and designing a class diagram to outline the relationships.

Sprint 2: Developed the core booking system functionalities, adding user stories and refining the system architecture to include basic booking capabilities and initial GUI elements.

Sprint 3: Focused on expanding the GUI functionalities using JavaFX:

Implemented a loading bar to provide feedback during processing times.
Added multiple language features to cater to diverse user bases.
Introduced dynamic background changes to enhance the GUI visual experience.
Integrated a bar chart for visual data presentation and an updated table viewer for better management and visualization of vehicle availability.
Key Technologies Utilized:
Programming Language: Java
Development Environment: Extensively used JavaFX for GUI development, adhering to best practices in software engineering.
Design Tools: Employed design patterns where applicable to optimize functionality and maintainability.
Achievements and Advanced Implementation:
The project exceeded basic requirements by integrating advanced features that significantly enhance user interaction and system functionality. These features demonstrated innovative use of JavaFX components and showcased a comprehensive understanding of GUI development and event handling in Java.

Documentation and Standards
Comprehensive documentation was provided, which included detailed explanations of the system architecture, user stories, class diagrams, and a well-structured report outlining the development process and the programming paradigms employed.

Conclusion
The ZipAbout project exemplifies high-level proficiency in Java programming and GUI design, reflecting a sophisticated approach to system development. This project highlighted my capabilities to develop advanced features that enhance usability and functionality, providing a user-friendly and visually appealing application for renting electric transport vehicles.
